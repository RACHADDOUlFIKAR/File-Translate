THE PROLOGUE
 
Decor
A neutral decor.Three similar doors.At the rising of the curtain, all the characters
are on stage.They chat, knit, play cards.
The prologue detaches and advances.
 
The prologue
So.These Characters will play the story of Antigone.Antigone is the little one
Skinny who is sitting there, and who says nothing.She looks straight ahead.She thinks.
She thinks what is going to be antigone going earlier, that she will suddenly arise with the skinny
young girl will harm and withdraw that nobody was taking seriously in the family and
Strengthen alone in front of the world, alone opposite Creon, his uncle, who is the king.
She thinks what will die, what is young and what aus Yes, she would have liked to live.
But there is nothing to do.Her name is Antigone and she will have to play her role
Until the end ... and, since this curtain has risen, she feels what moves to a
vertiginous speed of his sister Ismène, who chats and laughs with a young man, of
We all, who are there very quiet to look at it, of us who do not have to
die tonight.
The young man with whom the blonde speaks, the beautiful, the happy Ismene, it is Hémon, the
Son of Creon. It is the fiancé of Antigone.Everything was carrying it towards Ismene: its taste for
dance and games, its taste for happiness and success, its sensuality too, because
Ismène is much more beautiful than antigone;And then one evening, a ball evening where he had danced
that with Ismène, one evening when Ismene had been dazzling in her new dress, he was
find Antigone who dreamed in a corner, as at the moment, his arms surrounding his
knees, and he asked her to be his wife.Nobody never understood p What.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -

Antigone raised his serious eyes without astonishment on him and she said "yes" to him with a
Small sad smile ... The orchestra attacked a new dance, Ismène laughed out, there
low, in the middle of the other boys, and now he was going to be the husband now
Antigone.He did not know that he should never exist as an antigone husband on this
land and that this princely title only gave him the right to die.
This robust man has ux white hair, which meditates there, near his page, it is
Creon.He's the king.He has wrinkles, he is tired.He plays the difficult game of driving
men.Before, from Oedipus time, when he was only the first character in the
courtyard, he loved music, beautiful bindings, long strollers in small
Thebes antique dealers.But Oedipus and his sons died.He left his books, his
Objects, he rolled up his sleeves, and he took their place.
Sometimes, in the evening, he St tired, and he wonders if it is not in vain to drive the
men.If this is not a sordid office that we should leave to others, more crude ...
And then, in the morning, specific problems arise, which must be solved, and it rises,
Quiet, like a worker on the threshold of his day.
The old lady who knit, next to the nanny who raised the two little ones, it is
Eurydice, Créon's wife.She will knit throughout the tragedy until her
Tour just got up and die.She is good, worthy, loving.She is not
No help.Creon is alone.Alone with his little page which is too small and which does not
can nothing for him either.
This pale boy there, at the bottom, who dreams leaning against the wall, lonely, is the messenger.
It will come to announce Hémon's death earlier.That’s why he didn't
Want to chat or mingle with others.He already knows ...
Finally the three red men who play cards, their hats on the has
neck, these are the guards.They are not bad buggers, they have women,
children, and little troubles like everyone else, but they will grab you
most quietly accused of the world earlier.They feel garlic, leather and wine
red and they are devoid of any imagination.These are the auxiliaries always
innocent and always satisfied with themselves, of justice.For the moment, until this

that a new Th èbes duly mandated ordered them to stop him in turn, this
are the auxiliaries of Creon justice.
And now that you know them all, they will be able to play their story to you.
It begins when the two sons of Dœdipus, Summer and Polynice, which had to
reign over Thebes for a year each in turn, fought and knew under the
city walls, Summer Laîné, after the first year of power, having refused
to give way to his brother.Seven grand pr foreign inces that Polynice had won
To his cause were defeated in front of the seven doors of Thebes.Now the city is
Saved, the two enemy brothers died and Creon, the king, ordered that in summer, the
Good brother, it would be made funeral, but that Polynice, the Vaurian, the rebellion,
the thug, would be left without crying and without burial, the prey of crows and
jackals .. whoever dares to give him back the funeral duties will be mercilessly punished with
dead.
During That the prologue spoke, the characters came out one by one.The prologue
also disappears.Léclairage is modified on the scene.It is now a gray dawn and
Logs in a sleeping house.
Antigone opens the door and returns from Lexteriuri on the tip of his bare feet, his
shoes in hand.She remains motionless for a moment to listen to.
The nanny appears.

ANTIGONE
The garden was still sleeping.I was surprised, nurse.I have seen without any doubt.It is
beautiful, a garden that does not think yet to men.
NANNY
You went out.I was at the back of the bottom, you washed left.
ANTIGONE
In the fields, it was wet, and it was waiting.Everything was waiting for.I was doing a
huge noise on my own on the road and I was embarrassed, because I knew that this
It was not me we were waiting.So, I removed my sandals and I slipped into
The campaign without what Sen sees.
NANNY
You will have to wash your feet before going back to bed.
Ant Igon
I won't go back to bed this morning.
NANNY
At four o'clock!It was not four o'clock!I get up to see if she weren't

The night!It was night!And you want to make me believe that you were walking, liar!
From where does it come -you?
Antigone, has a strange smile.
It's true, it was still at night.And it was only me throughout the countryside at

Today.
NANNY
Do the crazy!Do the crazy!I know her, the song.I was a girl before you.And not
Convenient either, but head lasts like you, no.Where do you come from, bad?
Antigone, suddenly serious
No.Not bad.
NANNY
You had an appointment, huh?Say no N, maybe.
Antigone, slowly
Yes.I had a meeting.
NANNY
You have a lover?
Antigone, strangely, after a silence.
Yes, nanny, yes, the poor.I have a lover.
The nanny breaks out.
Ah!It's pretty!it's clean!You, the daughter of a king!Give yourself harm;give
You are struggling to raise them!They are all the same!You were not however
Like the others, you, to always attract yourself in front of the ice, to put you red to the

The boys will not see who is leading with its curls and its ribbons and they
will leave on the arms. "Well, you see, you were like your sister, and worse still,
hypocritical!Who is it?A thug, huh, maybe?A boy that you can't say to
Your family: "Here it is, he likes, I want to marry him." That's it, huh, right?
Answer, boastful!
Antigone, still has an imperceptible smile.
Yes, nurse.
NANNY
And she says yes!Mercy!I had all kid;I promised his poor mother that
I would make an honest girl, and that's it!But it's not going to happen like that, my little one.
I am only your nurse, and you treat me like an old beast;Good!But your uncle,
Your uncle Creon will know.I promise you!
Antigone, suddenly a little tired.
Yes, nanny, my uncle Creon will know.Leave me now.
NANNY
And you will see what he will say when he learns that you get up at night.And Hémon?And your
fiance?Because she is engaged!She is engaged and at four in the morning she leaves her
bed to run with another.And that tells you that we leave it, it would like us to
say nothing.Do you know what I should do?Beat like when you were little.
 
 
ANTIGONE
Nanny, you shouldn't scream too much.You shouldn't be too nasty This morning.
 
NANNY
Not shouting!I must not scream over the market!I who had promised your mother ...
What would me tell me, if she was there?"Old beast, yes, old beast, who did not know

Keep it pure, my little one.Always to shout, to make the watchdog, to turn them
Around with woolens for which do not take cold or chicken milks to
make them strong;But at four in the morning you sleep, old beast, You sleep, you who do not
Can't close your eye, and you let them go, marmot, and when you arrive, the bed is
cold!"This is what your mother will tell me, up there, when I go up there, and I will be ashamed,
ashamed to die if I was not already dead, and I can only lower my head and
Answer: "Madame Jocaste, it's true."
ANTIGONE
No, nurse.Do not Cry.You can look mom well in front, when you go
to find her.And she will say to you: "Hello, nanny, thank you for the little one E Antigone.You have good
taken care of it. "She knows why I went out this morning.
NANNY
Don't you have a lover?
ANTIGONE
No, nanny.
NANNY
Do you laugh at me, then?You see, I'm too old.You were my favorite, despite
Your dirty character.Your sister was softer, but I thought it was you who loved me.
If you loved me, you would have told me the truth.Why was your bed cold when I came to you
border?
ANTIGONE
Don't cry anymore, please, nanny.( She kisses her) Come on, my old good apple
red.You know when I rubbed you so that you shine?My old apple all wrinkled.Born

That for nothing.I am pure, I did not have a little love that, my fiancé, I

Between Ismène
 
 
 
Ismene
Have you already lifted?I come from your room.
ANTIGONE
Yes, I am already lifted.
NANNY
Both then! ... Both you will go crazy and get up before
Servants?You think it's good to be standing in the morning on an empty stomach, that it is
suitable for princesses?You are not only covered.You'll see
that you Go take me bad again.
ANTIGONE
Leave us, nanny.It is not cold, I stain;It is already lesté.Will make us
coffee.(She seated, suddenly tired) I would like a little coffee, please, please,
nanny.It would do me good.
NANNY
My dove!The head turns to be without anything and I am there like an idiot instead
to give him something hot.
 
She goes out quickly
 
Ismene
You are sick?
ANTIGONE
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 10 -
It's nothing.A Little fatigue.(She smiles) It is because I got up early.
Ismene
I didn't sleep either.
Antigone, still smiles
You should sleep.You would be less beautiful tomorrow.
Ismene
Do not laugh.
ANTIGONE
I'm not laughing.It reassures me this morning, that you are beautiful.When I was
Little, I was so unhappy, do you remember?I smelled you from the ground, I put you
to the neck.Once I got attached to a tree and I cut your hair, your
beautiful hair x ... (she caresses dismense hair) as it should be easy not to
not think of nonsense with all these beautiful smooth and well -ordered locks around
the head!
 
Ismène, suddenly
Why are you talking about something?
 
 
Antigone, gently, without ceasing to caress her hair
I'm not talking about something ...
 
Ismene
You know, I thought well, Antigone.
ANTIGONE
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 11 -
Yes.
Ismene
I thought well all night.You're crazy.
ANTIGONE
Yes.
Ismene
None s can't.
Antigone, after a silence, of his little voice
For what?
Ismene
He would make us die.
ANTIGONE
Of course.Has each their role.He must kill us, and we have to go
bury our brother.This is how it was distributed.What do you want
We do it?
Ismene
I do not want to die.
Antigone, slowly
I also wanted to die.
Ismene
Listen, I thought well all night.I am the eldest.I think more than to i.You,
This is what goes through your head right away, and too bad if it is stupidity.I am
more weighted.I'm thinking.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 12 -
ANTIGONE
There are times when you shouldn't think too much.
Ismene
Yes, Antigone.Dabord is horrible, of course, and I have mercy on my brother too, but
I understand our uncle a little.
ANTIGONE
I don't want to understand a little.
Ismene
He is the king, he must give thexample.
ANTIGONE
I am not l e king.I must not give thexample, me ... what happens to him
By the head, the little antigone, the dirty beast, slow, the bad, and then we put it in
A corner or in a hole.And it's well done for her.She was not to disobey.
 
Ismene
Come on!Come on!… Your joined eyebrows, your right gaze in front of you and you are launched without
Listen to anyone.Listen to me.I have reason more often than you.
ANTIGONE
I don't want to be right.
Ismene
Try to understand at least!
Antigon E
Understanding ... You have that this word in the mouth, all since I have been
very small.It was necessary to understand that we cannot touch the water, to the beautiful and fleeting
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 13 -
Cold water because it wet the slabs, to the earth because it stains the dresses.He
had to understand that we should not eat at the same time, give everything that we have in
his pockets in the beggar that meets, running, running in the wind until we
falls to the ground and drink q Uand we are hot and bathe when it is too early or too late,
But not just when you want!To understand.Always understand.I don't want
not understand.I will understand when I am old.(She ends slowly.) If I
become old.Not now.
Ismene
It is stronger than us antigone.He is the king. And they all think like him in the
city.They are thousands and thousands around us, swarming in all the streets
of Thebes.
ANTIGONE
I don't tear e not.
Ismene
They will hure us.They will take us with their thousand bars, their thousand faces and their
unique look.They will spit in our face.And we will have to move forward in their hatred on the
cart with their smell and laughter until torture.And there, there will be the guards with
Their dumped heads, congestioned on their steep passes, their big washed hands,
their beef gaze that we feel that we can always cry, try to make them
Understand, that they go like negotiations res and that they will do everything they have been told
Scrupulously, without knowing if it is good or bad ... and suffer?It will be necessary to suffer, to feel
that the pain rises, what happened to the point where we can no longer bear it;that he
What burst should, but what continues however and still goes up, like a voice
Acute… Oh!I can't, I can't ...
ANTIGONE
How well you thought everything!
Ismene
All night long.Not you?
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 14 -
ANTIGONE
Yes, of course.
 
Is LED
Me, you know, I am not very courageous.
Antigone, slowly
Me neither.But what is it?
 
There is a silence, Ismène suddenly asks:
Ismene
So don't you want to live?
Antigone, murmur
Not want to live ... (and more slowly, if possible.) Who got up
First, in the morning, just to feel the cold on her bare skin?That was sleeping the
last, only when she could no more fatigue, to live a little more
plus the nude it?Who was already crying, thinking that there were so many little animals,
So many Dherbe strands in the near and that we could not take them all?
Ismène, has a sudden momentum towards her
My little sister…
Antigone, stands up and shouts.
Oh no!Leave me!Don't caress me!Don't start whining
Together, now.You thought well, you say?You think the whole howling city
Against you, do you think that pain and fear of dying is enough?
Ismène, lower the head.
Yes
ANTIGONE
Save yourself from these pretexts.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 15 -
Ismene, throws herself against her.
Antigone!I beg you!It's good for men to believe in ideas and die
for them.You are a girl.
Antigone, tight teeth
A girl, yes.I cried enough to be a girl!
Ismene
Your happiness is there in front of you and you only have to take it.You are engaged, you are young, you
is beautiful…
Antigone, deafness
No, I'm not beautiful.
Ismene
Not beautiful c So, but otherwise.You know that it is on you that
Return the small thugs in the street;how little girls watch
Pass, suddenly silent, without being able to take your eyes off until you have turned
the corner.
Antigone, has an imperceptible smile.
Thugs, little girls ...
Ismène, after a time.
And Hémon, Antigone?
Antigone, closed
I will speak to Hémon every time: Hémon will be an adjusted business at the time.
Ismene
You're crazy.
Antigone , smiles
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 16 -
You have always said that I was crazy, for everything, always.Go back to sleep,
Ismène ... It is day now, you see, and, anyway, I will not be able to do anything.My
dead brother is now surrounded by exactly as Sil had managed to
Make king.Go back to sleep.You are very pale with fatigue.
Ismene
And you?
ANTIGONE
I don't want to sleep ... but I promise you that I will not move before your
awakening.Nanny Mapporter to eat.Go sleeping again.The sun only rises.
You have your eyes very small in sleep.Go…
Ismene
I will convince you, right?Will I convince you?Will you let me talk to you again?
Antigone, a little tired.
I'll let you talk to me, yes.I'll let you talk to me all.Go sleeping now,
You're welcome.You would be less beautiful tomorrow.(She watches her go out with a little smile
Sad, then she suddenly falls on a chair.) Poor Ismène!
 
 
 
nanny, between.
Here, here you are a good coffee and sandwiches, my pigeon.Eat.
ANTIGONE
I'm not very hungry, nurse.
NANNY
I grilled them myself and buttered as you like them.
ANTIGONE
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 17 -
You are kind, nanny.I'm only going to drink a little.
NANNY
Where does it hurt?
ANTIGONE
Nowhere, nanny.But do me all the same hot as when I was
sick ... nanny stronger than fever, nanny stronger than nightmare, more
F toe that the groan of the rican and turns an hour on time on the wall,
stronger than the thousand insects of silence that gnaw at something, somewhere
In the night, stronger than the night itself with its mad hulular than one that
not;Nanny stronger than death.Give me your hand like when you stayed next to it
from my bed.
NANNY
What do you have, my little dove?
ANTIGONE
Nothing, nanny.I'm only a bit small for all this.But there is only
You who must know it.
NANNY
Too small, why, my tose?
ANTIGONE
For nothing, nanny.And then you are there.I hold your good rough hand that saves from
Everything, always, I know it well.Maybe what will save me again.You are so powerful,
nanny.
NANNY
What do you want me to do, my dovere?
ANTIGONE
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 18 -
Nothing, nanny.Only your hand like this on my cheek.(She stays the
eyes closed.) Here, I na I more afraid.Neither of the bad ogre, nor of the sandman, nor
of Taoutaou who passes and takes the children ... (still silence, she continues a
Another tone.) Nanny, you know, sweet, my female dog ...
NANNY
Yes.
ANTIGONE
You will promise me that you will never rumble it again.
NANNY
A beast that dirty everything with its legs!It shouldn't go into houses!
ANTIGONE
Even if she dirty everything.Promise, nurse.
NANNY
So I will have to let it damage everything without RI say it?
ANTIGONE
Yes, nanny.
NANNY
Ah!It would be a bit strong!
 
 
 
ANTIGONE
You like it, nanny.You love well, sweet, with his good big head.And then, at
Background, you like to rub too.You would be very unhappy if everything was clean
always.So I ask you: don't rumble it.
NANNY
What if she piss on my carpets?
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 19 -
ANTIGONE
Promise you won't rumble it.I pray, say, I pray,
nanny…
THERE NURSE
You take advantage of what you cuddle ... It's good.It's good.We will wipe without saying anything.You
Turn me in a brut.
ANTIGONE
And then, also promise me that you will talk to him, that you will speak to him often.
The nanny increases the shoulders
Have we seen that?Talk to the beasts!
ANTIGONE
And precisely not like a beast.Like a real person, as you
lie ...
NANNY
Ah, that no!At my age, make Lidiote!But why do you want the whole house to him
speak like you, to This beast?
Antigone, slowly
If I, for one reason or another, I could not speak to him anymore ...
The nanny, who does not understand.
No more talk to him, no longer speak to her?For what?
Antigone, turns her head a little and then adds, her voice hard.
And then, if she was too sad, if she had too much to date all the same, her nose
Under the door like when I got out, it might be better
Nanny, without what harm.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 20 -
 
 
NANNY
Make her kill, my cute?Make your bitch kill?But you're crazy this morning!
ANTIGONE
No, nanny.(Hémon appears).Here is Hémon.Leave us, nanny.And don't do this
that you are sworn.
 
The nanny comes out.
 
 
 
 
Antigone, runs to Hémon.
Sorry, Hémon, for our argument of the evening and for everything.I was wrong.I
Pray to forgive me.
Hemon
You know that I was forgiven, hardly you had slammed the door.Your perfume was
again there and I tav Already forgiven.(He holds her in his arms, he smiles, he looks at her.) A
Who was you washed stolen, this perfume?
ANTIGONE
In Ismene.
Hemon
And lipstick, powder, beautiful dress?
ANTIGONE
Also
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 21 -
Hemon
In what honor did you have so beautiful?
ANTIGONE
I will tell you.(She squeezes herself a little stronger) Oh!my darling, like I was
beast!A whole night was wasted.A beautiful evening.
Hemon
We will have other evenings, antigone.
 
ANTIGONE
Maybe not.
Hemon
And other arguments too.It's full of arguments, happiness.
ANTIGONE
Happiness, yes ... Listen, Hémon.
Hemon
Yes
 
ANTIGONE
Don't laugh this morning.Be serious.
Hemon
I am serious.
ANTIGONE
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 22 -
And tighten me.Stronger than you are never tight.That all your strength simplif in
Me.
Hemon
There.With all my strength.
Antigone, in a breath.
It's good.(They stay for a moment without saying anything, then it starts slowly.)
Listen, Hémon. Hemon
Yes.
ANTIGONE
I wanted to tell you this morning ... the little boy we would have had both ...
Hemon
Yes.
ANTIGONE
You know, I was tired of everything.
Hemon
Yes, Antigone.
ANTIGONE
Oh!I was tightening so hard that he would never have been afraid, I swear.Nor the evening that
come, neither from the LangoISSE of the full sun, nor of the shadows ... our little boy,
Hémon!He would have had a very small and poorly combed mother but safer than all
The real mothers of the world with the true breasts and their large aprons.You
Believe, right?
Hemon
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 23 -
Yes my love.
ANTIGONE
And you also think, isn't you, that you would have had a real woman?
Hémon, holds it.
I have a real woman.
Antigone, suddenly shouts, nestled against him.
Oh!You loved me, Hémon, you loved me, are you of course that evening?
Hémon, the rock slowly.
What evening?
ANTIGONE
You are of course that at this ball where you came to get me in my corner, you don't s not
deceived young girl?You are sure that you have never regretted since, never thought, even
Basically, even once you should have asked Ismene rather?
Hemon
Idiot!
ANTIGONE
You may, right?Do you may like a woman?Your arms that tighten me
do not lie?Your big hands placed on my back do not lie, nor your smell,
Neither this good hot nor this great confidence that Minions when I have my head in the hollow of your
neck?
 
 
Hemon
Yes, antigone, I love you like u Ne woman.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 24 -
ANTIGONE
I am black and skinny.Ismène is pink and golden like a fruit.
Hémon, whispers.
Antigone…
ANTIGONE
Oh!I am all red in shame.But I have to know this morning.Tell the truth.I
please.When you think I will be yours, do you feel in the midst of you like
A great hole that is digging, like something that dies?
Hemon
Yes, Antigone.
Antigone, in a breath, after a while.
I feel like that.And I wanted to tell you that yellowed was very proud to be your
woman, your real wife, on whom you would have put your hand, in the evening, by mugging, without
Think, as on something good to you.(She was detached from him, she took another
tone.) That's.Now I'm going to tell you about two things.And when I would have said, he
You will have to come out without questioning me.Even if they seem extraordinary to you,
Even if they hurt you.Swear it to me.
Hemon
What are you going to tell me e?
ANTIGONE
Swear to me, that you will go out without saying anything to me.Without even looking at me.If you
May, swear to me.(She looks at him with her poor face upset.) You see
As I ask you, swear to me, you like it, Hémon ... it's the last madness you
will pass me.
 
 
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 25 -
Hemon
I swear to you.
ANTIGONE
THANKS.So this is it.Yesterday.First of all.You asked me all the time why I had come
with a dismegligure dress, this perfume and this lèvr red es.I was stupid.I was not very
sure that you really want me and I had done all this to be a little more like the
Other girls, to make you want me.
Hemon
Was that for that?
ANTIGONE
Yes.And you laughed, and we argued and my bad character was the most
Strong, I saved myself.(She adds below.) But I had come to your place so that you
Take last night, so that I am your wife before.(He backs up, he's going to speak, she shouts.) You

That's all you can do for me if you may.(He came out. She stays without
Move, back to the room, then Ell he closes the window, she comes to know about a small
Chair in the middle of the scene, and says gently, as strangely appeased.) That's it.
It's over for Hémon, Antigone.
 
 
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -

Ismène, appealing, calling.
Antigone!… Ah!, You are there!
Antigone, without moving.
Yes, I am here.
Ismene.
I can not sleep.I was afraid that you will come out, and that you are trying to read despite
the day.Antigone, my little sister, we are all there, around you, Hémon, nanny And me, and sweet, your dog we are taiming and we are alive, we have we have
need you.Polynice is dead and he did not taim.He has always been a stranger to
We, a bad brother.Forget it, antigone, as he had forgotten us.Leave his
Hard shadow wander eternally without burial, since it is Creon's law.Do not try
Not what is above your strength.You always brave everything, but you are very small,
Antigone.Stay with us, don't go there last night, J e ten begs.
Antigone, lifted, a strange little smile on the lips, she goes towards the door and the threshold,
Gently, she says.)
It's too late.This morning, when you met, Jen came.
 
She is out.Ismene follows her with a cry:
Ismène
Antigone!
 
As soon as Quismène is out, Creon enters another door with his page.
 
Creon
A guard, do you say?One of those who keep the corpse?Make it in.
 
The guard enters.She’s a brute.For the moment, it is green for fear.
Jeans Anouilh - Antigone -
- 27 -
The guard presents itself, at the guard to you.
Guard Jonas, from the second company.
Creon
What do you want?
THE GUARD
There, chief.We drew lots to find out the one who came.And the spell fell on
Me.So, there, chief.I came because we thought it was better than there was
That explains, and then because the three of you could not abandon the post.
We are the three of the guard stake, chief, around the corpse.
Creon Do you have to tell me?
THE GUARD
There are three of us.chief.I am not alone.The others are Durand and the guard of
First Boudousse class.
Creon
Why wasn't it the first class that came?
THE GUARD
Isn't that, chef?I say right away, me.This is the first class that owes there
go.When there is no rank, the first class is responsible.But the
Others, they said no and they wanted to draw lots.Do I have to get the first
clas Se, chief?
Creon
No.Speak, you, since you are there.
THE GUARD
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 28 -
I have seventeen years of service.I am volunteer, the medal, two quotes.I
am well rated, chief.I am a service.I only know what is ordered.My
superiors, they always say: "With Jonas, we are quiet."
Creon
It's good.Speak.What are you afraid of?
THE GUARD
Regularly, it should have been the first class.I am offered first
class, but I am not yet promoted.I had to be promoted in June.
Creon
Are you going to talk, finally?Sil has happened, the three of you are
responsible.No longer looking for who should be there.
THE GUARD
Well, there, chef: the corpse ... We watched, however!We had the next generation of two
hours, the hardest.You know what it is, when night is going to end.This lead
Between the eyes, the neck that pulls, and then all these shadows that move and the fog
the early morning that rises… Ah! They chose their time well! ... We were there, we were talking, we
Beat the sole ... We did not sleep, chef, that, we can swear it all three
didn't sleep!Besides, with the cold that he did ... suddenly, I look at the
corpse ... We were a stone's throw away, but I looked at it from time to time
Even ... I am like that, me, chef, I am meticulous.This is why my
superiors, they say: "With Jonas ..." (a gesture by Creon Larver, he suddenly shouts.) It's
me who Lai given the first, chef!The others will tell you, it was I who gave the first
Lalarm.
Creon
Lalarm?For what?
THE GUARD
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 29 -
The corpse, chef.Someone washed covered.Oh!not much.They hadn't had
Time, with us next to it.Only a little soil ... but quite the same for
hide it from vultures.
Creon, goes to him.
Are you sure it's not a beast by scratching?
 
THE GUARD
No, chef.We hoped for that too.But the Earth was thrown on him.According to
the rites.It was someone who knew what he was doing.
 
Creon
Who dared?Who was crazy enough to brave my law?Have you raised traces?
THE GUARD
Nothing, chef.Nothing lighter than a passing of Deiseau.Afterwards, looking
Better still, the Durand guard found further a shovel, a small, old -fashioned shovel,
all rusty.We thought it couldn't be a child who had done it.THE
First class the guard all the same for Len quest.
Creon, dreams a little.
A child… Broken lapposition that already undermines everywhere.Polynice's friends
With their gold blocked in Thebes, the heads of the stinking plebs Lail, suddenly allies
To princes, and the priests trying to fish for something in the middle of all this ...
A child!They must have thought it would be more touching.I see him in their child, with
Her mouth of a pole killer and the little shovel carefully wrapped in paper
under his jacket.Unless they are have drawn up a real child, with sentences ... a
invaluable innocence for the party.A real pale little boy who will spit in front of my
rifles.A precious very fresh blood on my hands, double boon.(He goes to the man.)
But they have accomplices, and in my guard, perhaps.Listen well, you ...
THE GUARD
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 30 -
Chef, we did everything we had to do!Durand seated half an hour because
that it had pain in the feet, but I, chef, I stayed all the t Standing emps.The first
class will tell you.
Creon
Who have you ever talked about this case?
THE GUARD
To no one, chief.We immediately drawn, and I came.
Creon
Listen carefully.Your guard is doubled.Return the next generation.Here is the order.I do not want
that you near the corpse.And not a word.You are all guilty of a negligence,
You will be punished anyway, but if you speak, if the noise runs in the city that we have
covered the corpse of Polynice, you will all die the three.
 
The guard, mouth.
We did not speak, chef, I swear!But, I was here, and maybe others,
They already said to the next generation ... (he sweats with big drops, he stammers.) Chef, I have two
children,.There is one that is very small.You will testify for me that I was here, chief,
before the war council.I was here, with you!I have a witness!If we talked, that
Will be the others, it won't be me!I have a witness, me!
Creon
Go quickly.If no one knows, you live as.(The guard comes out while running. Creon remains a
Sunny moment.Suddenly, he whispers.) A child ... (he took the little page by lepaule.)
Come, small.We have to tell all of this now ... and then, the pretty
work will start.Would you die for me?You think you would go with your little one
shovel?(The little one looks at him. He takes out with him, caressing his head.) Yes, of course, you would go everything
Immediately, you too ... (we slowly sigh while leaving.) A child ...
 
They came out s.The choir enters.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -

THE CHOIR
And There you go.Now the spring is bandaged.It is more than taking place on its own.It is
which is convenient in the tragedy.We give the little boost so that it
Starts, nothing, a look for a second to a girl who passes and lifts her arms in
the street, a desire for a beautiful morning, upon waking up, like something that is
Eat, a question of too much that as long as one evening arises ... that's all.Afterwards, we have more quà
Let go.We are quiet.It rolls alone.It's meticulous, well oiled since
always.Death, betrayal, despair are there, ready, and the bursts, and thunderstorms,
And the silences, all the silences: the silence when the executioner's arm rises at the end, the
silence at the beginning when the two lovers are naked in front of the other for the
first time, without daring to move immediately, in the dark room, silence when
The cries of the crowd burst around of the winner and it looks like a film whose sound is
crammed, all these open mouths from which he does not come out, all this clamor which is
that an image, and the winner, already defeated, alone in the midst of his silence ...
It's clean, tragedy.It's relaxing, it's safe ... in drama, with these traitors,
with these relentless bad guys, this persecuted innocence, these avengers, these land-
New, these Low Despoir, it becomes appalling to die, like an accident.We
might have been saved, The good young man might have happened in time
With the gendarmes.In the tragedy, we are quiet.Dabord, we are between ourselves.We are
All innocent, in short!It is not because there is one who kills and the other who is killed.
This is a question of distribution.And above all, it's relaxing, tragedy, because
knows that it has no more despication, dirty hope;that it is taken, that it is finally taken as a
rat, with all the sky on his back, and what is more than shouting, not to moan, no n, not to
complain, to yell at full voice what had to say, that it was never said and what
Maybe didn't even know yet.And for nothing: to say it to yourself, to be lappre,
self.In the drama, we struggle because we hope to get out.It is ignoble, it is utility.
There, it's free.It is for kings.And he has nothing to try, finally!
 
Antigone has entered, driven by the guards.
THE CHOIR
So that's it, it starts.The little antigone is taken.The little Antigone V has
be able to be itself for the first time.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 32 -
The choir disappears, while the guards grow antigone on stage.
 
The guard, which resumed all its component.
Come on, come on, not dhistories!You will explain yourself in front of the chief.I don't know
than the instructions.What you had to do there, I don't want to know.Everybody has
Escuses, everyone has something to object.If it had to listen to people, silly
had to try to understand, We would be clean.Come on!Keep it, you, and
no stories!Me, what to say, I don't want to know!
ANTIGONE
Tell them to let go, with their dirty hands, they hurt me.
 
THE GUARD
Their dirty hands?You could be polished, miss ... I am polite.
ANTIGONE
Tell them to let go.I am the daughter of Oedipus, I am antigone.I will not save myself
not.
THE GUARD
The dœdipus girl, yes!The fucking that we pick up at night care, they also say
from SE M Enify, who are the good friend of the prefect of police!
 
They laugh.
ANTIGONE
I want to die, but not that they touch me!
THE GUARD
And the corpses, say, and the earth, isn't you afraid to touch?You say "their dirty
hands"!Look at yours a bit.
 
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 33 -
Antigone looks at his hands run by handcuffs with a little smile.They are
full of earth.
THE GUARD
Were you to take you, your shovel?You had to redo this with your nails, the second
times?Ah!This audacity.I turn my back for a second, I ask you for a quil, and
Come on, time to stall it in the cheek, time to say thank you, she was there, scratching
like a small hyena.And in broad daylight!And it was struggling, this bitch, when
I wanted to take it!What wanted to jump into my eyes!She shouted that it was necessary
Finish ... it's crazy, yes!
The second guard
I stopped another, crazy, the day.She showed her ass to people
THE GUARD
Say, shield, what the three of us will pay for each other, to
to celebrate that!
The second guard
In the twisted.He's good, his red.
The third guard
We have free neighborhood on Sunday.If we took women?
THE GUARD
No, between us that we laugh ... with women, there are always stories, and then
Moutards who want to piss.Ah!say, a bushy, all the time, we did not believe
That we would like to laugh like that, we others!
THE TWO Ith
They may give us a reward.
THE GUARD
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 34 -
It may be, if it is important.
The second guard
Flachard, from the third, when he got his hand on shroud last month, he
had the double month.
The third guard
Ah, say!If we have the double month, I propose: instead of the twist, we are going
At the Arab Palace.
THE GUARD
To drink?Your crazy steps?They sell you the bottle double at the palate.In order to climb,
dacco RD.Listen to me, I'll tell you: we're going to dabord at the twist, we wedge them
As it is necessary and then we go to the palace.Say, shield, you remember the big one,
palace?
The second guard
Ah!What Tetais drunk, you, that day!
The third guard
But our women, if we have the month doubles, they will know.If it is, we will be
perhaps publicly congratulated.
THE GUARD
So we'll see.The fun is something else.There is a ceremony in the courtyard of
the barracks, as for the Decorations, women will also come, and kids.And
So we will all go to the twisted.
The second guard
Yes, but it will be necessary to order the Davance menu.
Antigone, asks for a small voice.
I would like a little, please.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 35 -
The guard, after a time of reflection.
It's good, what sasseye.But don't let it go, you.
 
 
 
 
Creon enters, the guard at the mouth immediately.
THE GUARD
Take care of yourself!
Creon, stopped, surprised.

was struggling like a devil, she wanted to continue again, she shouted me from the
Leave, that the body was not yet completely covered
Creon, in Antigone.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 37 -
It's true?
ANTIGONE
Yes, it's true.
THE GUARD
We discovered the body, like fair, and then we passed the next generation, not to mention
Nothing, and we came to row you, chef.So.
Creon
And that night, the first time was you too?
ANTIGONE
Yes.It was Me.With a small iron shovel that used us to make castles of
Sand on the beach, during the holidays.It was precisely the polynice shovel.He had
engraved his name with a knife on the handle.That’s why I got up near him.
But they were taken.So the second time, I had to start again with my hands.
THE GUARD
It looked like a little beast that was scratching.Same as the first stroke, with lair
Hot who was trembling, the comrade said, "No, it's a beast.""" Do you think, I tell him,
It's too fine for a beast.It's a girl."
Creon
It's good.You may be asked for a report every time.For now,
Leave me alone with her.Conduct these men next to it, small.And that they remain secret
until I come back to see them.
THE GUARD
Should we give him the handcuffs, chef?
Creon
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 38 -
No.
 
The guards came out, preceded by the small page.
 
 
 
 
Creon and Antigone are alone in front of the other.
Creon
Had you talked about your project to someone?
ANTIGONE
No.
Creon
Have you met someone on your way?
ANTIGONE
No, no one.
Creon
Are you sure?
ANTIGONE
Yes.
Creon
So listen: you are going to go home, go to bed, say that you are sick, that you are
Not released since yesterday.Your nurse will say like you.I will make these three men disappear.
ANTIGONE
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 39 -
For what?Since you know that I will start again.
 
A silence.They re keep.
Creon
Why did you try to hold your brother?
ANTIGONE
I had to.
Creon
I was washing.
Antigone, slowly.
I owed it all the same.Those who are not nonely wander forever without ever
find rest.If my living brother had come back harassé a long hunting, I
would have removed his shoes, I would have made her eat, I would have prepared her bed ...
Polynice today has finished hunting.He goes home where my father and my mother,
and Etéocle aus Yes, lattende.He is entitled to rest.
Creon
It was a rebellious and a traitor, you knew it.
ANTIGONE
He was my brother.
Creon
You had heard proclaimed Lédit at the crossroads, you had read Laffiche on all walls
from the city?
ANTIGONE
Yes.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 40 -
Creon
You knew the fate that was promised to the one, whatever it is, who would dare to return the
Funny honors?
ANTIGONE
Yes I knew it.
Creon
You may have thought that being Oedipus' daughter, the daughter of Lorgueil of Oedipus, it was quite
to be above the law.
ANTIGONE
No.I didn't think that.
Creon
The law is made for you, Antigone, the law is made for the girls of kings!
ANTIGONE
If I had been a servant doing her dishes, when I heard Lédit read,
Jaur would suffered from my arms and I would have come out with my apron to go
bury my brother.
 
 
Creon
It’s not true.If you had been a servant, you wouldn't have doubted that you were going to
Die and you would have remained to cry your brother at home.Only you thought you were
of royal race, my niece and the fiancée of my son, and that, whatever happens, I would nose
not kill you.
ANTIGONE
You are wrong.I was sure that you would make me die on the contrary.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 41 -
Creon, looks at it and suddenly whispers.
LORGUEIL DœDIPE.You are Lorgueil Dœdipus.Yes, now that I was found at the bottom of
Your eyes, I believe you.You had to pe nser that I would make you die.And it seemed to you a
natural outcome for you, proud!For your father either I do not say the
Happiness, there was not what human misfortune was not too little.Lhuman bothers you
to the family's surroundings.You need a head to head with fate and death.And kill
your father and sleep with your mother and learn all of this afterwards, greedily, a word by
word.What drink, huh, words that condemn you?And as we drink them
greedy when you get away with Oedipus, or Antigone.And the simplest, afterwards, is still
To die and daller begging with your children on the roads ... Well, no.
These times are over for Thebes.Thebes A owes a prince without
history.Me, I only maple Creon, thank God.I have my two feet on the ground,
My two hands sunk in my pockets, and, since I am king, I have resolved, with
less dambition than your father, to simply make the order of C e
a little less absurd world, if possible.It is not even an adventure, it is
A job for everyday and not always funny, like all trades.But
Since I'm here to do it, I'm going to do it ... and if tomorrow a grumpy messenger
Uneas the background of the mountains to Mannoncer that it is not very sure either of my
birth, I will simply pray to it to go back it comes and I will not go i
to look so little to look at your aunt under the nose and start confronting the dates.The Kings
have something else to do than personal pathetic, my little girl.(He was her, he
Take the arm.) So listen to me well.You are antigone, you are the daughter dœdipus, either, but you
as twenty years old and he has not long has long this would have settled by dry bread and
A pair of giffles.(He looks at her, smiling.) Try you away!You haven't looked at you,
sparrow!You are too skinny.Growing a little, rather, to make a big boy in Hémon.
Thebes needs it More than your death, I get boring you.You will go home all
Following, do what I say and silence you.I take care of the silence of others.Go ahead!And
Don't light me like that.You take me for a brute, it is understood,
And you must think that I am definitely very prosaic.But I love you all about
Even with your dirty character.Not that it is I who made your gift of your
First doll, he's not so long.
 
Antigone does not answer.She's going to come out ir.He drives out.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 42 -
Creon
Antigone!It is through this door that you return to your room.Where are you going by that?
Antigone, stopped, she replied gently, without a praising.
You know it well…
 
 
 
 
A silence.They are still looking at each other in front of the other.
Creon, whispers, as for him.
What game do you play?
ANTIGONE
I am not playing.
Creon
So you do not understand that if someone otherwise that these three bullies knows everything
The hour what you have ten tend to do, I will be forced to kill you?If you shut up
Now, if you give up this madness, I have a chance to save you, but I was not launched
More in five minutes.Do you understand it?
ANTIGONE
I have to bury my brother that these men discovered.
Creon
Would you go back to this absurd gesture?There is another guard around Polynice's body
And, even if you manage to cover it again, we will give off his corpse, you know it.
What can you therefore otherwise tensanglant Ore the nails and make you take?
ANTIGONE
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 43 -
Nothing other than that, I know it.But that, at least, I can.And we have to do what
one can.
Creon
So you really believe in this burial in the rules?To this shadow of your
brother condemned to wander always if we do not throw a little earth into the corpse
With the priest's formula?You have already heard them recite it, to the priests of Thebes, the
formula?You saw these poor heads dem tired bent shortening the gestures, swallowing
The words, slumping this death to take another before the midday meal?
ANTIGONE
Yes, I saw them.
Creon
Have you never thought when it was a being you really liked, who
Was there, lying in this box, would you all of a sudden scream?To cry out
be silent, to go?
 
ANTIGONE
Yes, I thought.
Creon
And you risk death now because I refused your brother it pass
derisory, this Strong stroke on his body, this pantomime you would have been
The first to be ashamed and bad if we were washed.It's absurd!
ANTIGONE
Yes, it's absurd.
Creon
Why are you doing this gesture, then?For the others, for those who believe in it?For the
Place against me?
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 44 -
ANTIGONE
No.
Creon
Neither for others, nor for your brother?Who then?
ANTIGONE
For no one.In my opinion.
Creon, looks at it in silence.
So you want to m To go?You've lair a little game caught.
ANTIGONE
Don't touch on me.Do like me.Do what you have at
TO DO.But if you are a human being, do it quickly.That's all I ask you.
I’ll not have courage forever, it's true.
Creon, is getting closer.
I want to save you, Antigone.
ANTIGONE
You are the king, you can everything, but that, you can't.
Creon
You think?
ANTIGONE
Neither save me nor to compel.
Creon
Proud!Small Oedipus!
ANTIGONE
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 45 -
You can only kill me.
Creon
What if I have you torture?
ANTIGONE
For what?So that I cry, that I ask thanks, so that I swear everything we
will want to, and that I start again after, when I will no longer be bad?
Creon, hugs her arm.
Listen to me carefully.I have the bad role, it is understood, and you have the right one.And you feel it.But
nen still not enjoy too much, small plague ... If I were a good ordinary brute of
tyrant , it would have been a long time since we torn off the tongue, pulled the members from
pincers, or thrown into a hole.But you see in my eyes something that hesitates, you
See that I let you speak instead of my soldiers;So, you taunt, you attack
As long as you can.Where do you want to come, little fury?
ANTIGONE
Let me go.You hurt me with your hand.
Creon, who tightens stronger.
No.I am the strongest like that, I also enjoy it.
Antigone, pushes a p Etit Cri.
Ouch!
Creon, whose eyes laugh.
Maybe this is what I should do after all, simply twist your wrist,
Drawn your hair as you do with girls in games.(He looks at her again. He
becomes serious again.He says to her nearby.) I am your uncle, it is understood, but we do not
are not tender for each other, in the family.It doesn't seem to you
Funny, all the same, this flouted king who tends, this old man who can everything and who has
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 46 -
given to kill other, I stack, and tenderly tender as you, and who is there, to give himself
All this sentence to try to tempt to die?
Antigone, after a while.
You will be too much, now.It doesn't even hurt me anymore.I have no more arms.
Creon, looks at her and lets her go with a little smile.He whispers.
God, however, knows if I have something to do today, but I will still
Land the time it will be necessary and save yourself, small plague.(He does it as seal on a chair at
middle of the room.He removes his jacket, he skills towards her, heavy, powerful, in the arms of
shirt.) In the aftermath of a failed revolution, there was work to do, I
lasure.But urgent affairs will wait.I don't want to let you die in a
history of politics.You are better than that.Because your polynice, this shadow
grieving and this body that breaks down between its guards and all this pathetic which
Tenflamme, this is a story of politics EU.Dabord, I am not tender, but I
am delicate;I like what is clean, clear, well washed.You think it doesn't disgust me
As much as you, this meat that rots in the sun?In the evening, when the wind comes from the sea,
We already feel it from the palace.It raises my heart.However, I won't even go
Close my window.It is despicable, and I can even tell you, it's stupid,
Monstrously stupid, but all thebes must feel this for some time.
You think I Laur Ais makes your brother buried, if only for hygiene!But
For the brutes I governing to understand, it must stink the corpse of
Polynice throughout the city, for a month.
ANTIGONE
You are odious!
Creon
Yes my little one.This is the job that wants it.What we can discuss is if you have to do it
or not do it.But if we do, you have to do it like that.
ANTIGONE
Why are you doing it?
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 47 -
Creon
One morning, I realized Eilling king of Thebes.And God knows if I have something else in the
life to be powerful ...
ANTIGONE
We had to say no, then!
Creon
I could.Only, I suddenly felt like a worker who
refused a work.It didn't seem honest.I said yes.
ANTIGONE
Well, too bad for you.I didn't say "yes"!What do you want
It makes me, to me, your policy, your necessities, your poor stories?Me, I can
say "no" yet to all that I don't like it and I am the sole judge.And you, with your
Crown, with your guards, with your paraphernalia, you can only kill me
Because you said "yes".
Creon
Listen to me.
ANTIGONE
If I want, I can not listen to you.You said "yes".I have nothing more to
learn from you.Not you.You are there, to drink my words.And if you coat
Not your guards, it is to disbelief until the end.
Creon
You mamuses.
ANTIGONE
No.I scare you.It's for Cel So you try to save me.It would be
all the same more convenient to keep a small antigone lively and silent in this
palace.You are too sensitive to make a good tyrant, that's all.But you are going to
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 48 -
even kill me earlier, you know, and that is why you have
fear.It’s ugly a man who is afraid.
Creon, deafness.
Well, yes, I am afraid of being forced to be killed if you Tobstines.And I wouldn't want it
not. ANTIGONE
I don't have to do what I don't want!You wouldn't want
No longer, maybe, refuse a grave to my brother?So say it, that you did not last
not intended?
Creon
I told you.
ANTIGONE
And you wash all the same.And now you are going to be killed without the
to want.And that's it, to be king!
Creon
Yes, that's it!
ANTIGONE
Poor Creon!With my broken and earthy nails and the Blues that your guards
Mont made on the arms, with my pe Ur that twists my stomach, I am queen.
Creon
So, have mercy on me, live.The corpse of your brother who rots under my windows is
Quite paid enough for the order to reign in Thebes.My son Taime.Do not laugpery to pay
With you again.I have paid enough.
ANTIGONE
No.You said "yes".You will never stop paying now!
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 49 -
Creon, suddenly shakes her out of him.
But, good God!Try to understand a minute, you too, little id takes away!I have good
Try to understand you, me.However, there must be some who say yes.However, it is necessary
Let there be some who lead the boat.It takes water from all sides, it's full of
Crimes, stupidity, misery ... and the rudder is the one who tosses.Léquipage does not want
nothing more, he thinks that the hold and the officers are already being
Build a comfortable little raft, just for them, with the whole Deau provision
soft, to shoot their bones at least of the.And the mast cracks, and the wind whistles, and the sails
will tear each other apart, and all these brutes will die all together, because what
think that of their skin, their precious skin and their small things.Do you think, then,
Whether you have time to do the refined, to know if you have to say "yes" or "no", to
ask if you will not pay too much one day, and if we can still be a
Man after?We take the end of wood, we straighten in front of the mountain of Deau, we

Whoever was gave fire, smiling the day before.He has more name.And you neither do you
Have no more names, clung to the bar.There is only the boat that has a name and the
storm.Do you understand that?
 
Antigone, shakes the head.
I don't want to understand.It is good for you.I am here for something other than
to understand.I'm here to tell you no and to die.
Creon
It's easy to say no!
ANTIGONE
Not always.
Creon
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 50 -
To say yes, you have to sweat and roll up your sleeves, grab life with full hands
And have put up to the elbows.It's easy to say no, even if you have to die.There is
that do not move and wait.Wait to live, attent Dr. even for you to kill you.
It's too loose.It’s an invention of men.You imagine a world where trees
also would have said no against sap, where the animals would have said no against the
Hunting or lamour?The animals, at least they are good and simple and hard.
They will, pushing each other after the other, courageously, on the same
path.And if they fall, the others pass and he can lose as much as long,
There will always be one of C a species ready to redo small and resume the
Same path with the same courage, all the same to those which have passed before.
ANTIGONE
What a dream, huh, for a king, animals!It would be so simple.
 
 
A silence, Creon looks at her.
Creon
You despise me, isn't it?(She does not answer, he continues as for him.) It is
Funny: I often imagined, this dialogue with a little pale young man who would have
Try to kill myself and from which I could not draw anything after contempt. But I do not
didn't think it would be with you and for something stupid ... (he took his head
in his hands.We feel that he is at the end of strength.) Listen to me anyway for the
last time.My role is not good, but it's my role, and I'm going to have you killed.
Only, before, I want you too to be sure of yours.You know why you are going
Die, Antigone?You know at the bottom of which sordid story you will sign forever
Your bloody little name?
ANTIGONE
What his His roof?
Creon
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 51 -
That deteocle and polynice, that of your brothers.No, you think you know, you don't know it
not.No one knows it in Thebes, only me.But it seems to me that you, this morning, you
also the right to lapar.(He dreams for a while, his head in his hands, leaning on
his knees.We slowly whisper.) It is not very beautiful, you will see.(And he starts
Deaf without looking at Antigone.) What do you remember with your brothers, dabord?Two
company games that probably despised you, which broke your dolls,
eternally whispering mysteries in Loreille Mon de Lautre to make you enraged?
ANTIGONE
Cited big ones ...
Creon
Afterwards, you must have admired them with their first cigarettes, their first pants
long;And then they started going out at night, feeling the man, and they don't go
looked at at all.
ANTIGONE
I was a girl ...
Creon
You saw your mother cry, your father get angry, you tended to slam
doors on their return and their sneers in the corridors.And they passed in front of you,
Gobogonards and Veules, feeling wine.
ANTIGONE
Once I meta hidden behind a door, it was in the morning, we came from
Raise, and they returned.Polynice my view, it was all pale, shiny and so beautiful eyes
In his evening garment!He said to me, "Here, are you there?"And he gave me a big
Flower he had brought in his night.
Creon
Jean has Nouilh - Antigone -
- 52 -
And you tire preserved, isn't this flower?And yesterday, before going, you opened
Your drawer and you tired for a long time, to give you courage?
 
Antigone, Tressaille.
Who told you that?
Creon
Poor Antigone, with your Cotillon flower!Do you know who was your brother?
ANTIGONE
I knew you would tell me about him anyway!
Creon
A little fool, a little hard and soulless carnivore, a little brute everything
Just good to go faster than the others with his cars, to spend more dargent
in the bars.Once I was there, your father had just refused him a big sum that he
had lost in the game;He became all pale and he raised his fist by shouting an ignoble word!
ANTIGONE
This is not true!
Creon
His brute fist on the fly in your father's face!It was pitiful.Your
Father was sitting at his table, head in his hands.He was bleeding from the nose.He was crying.And in
a corner of the office, polynice, sneering, which lit a cigarette.
Antigone, almost begs now.
This is not true!
Creon
Remember, you were twelve years old.You don't wash for a long time.It is
True, that?
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 53 -
Antigone, deafness.
Yes, it's true.
Creon
It was after this argument.Your father did not want to make him judge.He was engaged in
Argyenne tear.And, as soon as he was with the Argyans, the manhunt began
against your father, against this old man that I did not decide to die, to let go
kingdom.The attacks followed one another and the killers we took finished
Still by admitting that they had received a drop from him.Not just him, Besides.
Because that's what I want you to know, behind the scenes of this drama where you burn to play
A role, cooking.I had grandiose funeral yesterday in Etéocle.Etéocle is a
Hero and a saint for Thebes now.All the people were there.Children of
schools have gave all the money from their piggy bank for the crown;Old men,
falsely moved, magnified, with tremolos in his voice, the good brother, the son
Dœdipus, Prince Royal.Me too, I made a speech.And all the priests of Thebes at
Large complete, with the head of circumstance.And the military honors ... it was necessary.
You think I couldn't koff the luxury of a scoundrel in the
two camps.But I'm going to tell you something to you, something I know alone,
Something of Deffyable: Etéocle, this price of virtue, was not worth more than
Polynice.The good son had also tried to have his father murdered, the loyal prince
had also decided to sell Thebes to the most offender.Yes, do you think it's funny?
This betrayal for which the body of Polynice is rotting in the sun, I
proof now qutéocle, which sleeps in its tomb of marble, was preparing, he
Also, to commit it.This is a chance so p Olynice succeeded before him.We
dealt with two germs in the fair who were wounded by the other, cheating on us and
who slaughtered like two small thugs that they were, for a regulation of
Accounts ... Only, he found that I needed to make a hero of one.
So I was looking for their corpses in the middle of the others.We found them
Kissing for the first time in their lives, no doubt.They stirred
mutually, and then the load of Argyan cavalry had passed them.They
were in porridge, antigone, unrecognizable.I had one of the bodies, the least
damaged of both, for my national funeral, and I gave the order to let it rot
where he was.I don't even know which one.And I teach that it is very equal.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 54 -
 
There is a long silence, they do not move, without looking at each other, then antigone says gently:
ANTIGONE
Why did you tell this?
 
Creon gets up, puts back his jacket.
Creon
Was it better to let you die in this poor story?
ANTIGONE
Maybe.I thought.
 
There is still silence.Creon Sapproche Delle.
Creon
What are you going to do now?
Antigone, gets up like a somnanbule.
I will go back to my room.
Creon
Don't stay too lonely.Go see Hémon this morning.Marry yourself quickly.
Antigone, in a breath.
Yes.
Creon
You have all your life in front of you.Our discussion was very bird, I tass ure.You have this
Treasure, you, again.
ANTIGONE
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 55 -
Yes.
Creon
Nothing else matters.And you were going to waste it!I understand you, yellowed like
You at twenty.That's why I was drinking your words.Jécoutais from the bottom of the time a
Small lean and pale Creon like you and who thought only of giving everything too ...
Marry quickly, antigone, be happy.Life is not what you think.It is water
that young people let flow without knowing it, re open fingers.Firm your
Hands, close your hands, quickly.Hold it back.You will see, it will become a hard thing
And simple nibbled, sitting in the sun.They will tell you quite the opposite because they have
Need your strength and momentum.Do not listen to them.Don't disintegrate when I do my
Next speech in front of the Deteocle tomb.It will not be true.Nothing is true that
What we don't say ... you will lapprend, you too late, life is a book that we like,
It is a child Who plays at your feet, a tool he holds well in his hand, a bench for
Rest in the evening in front of your house.You will despise me again, but to discover
This, you will see, this is the derisory consolation of aging;life may be all about
even as happiness.
 
 
 
Antigone, whispers, lost look.
Happiness…
Creon, is a little sudden.
A poor word, huh?
ANTIGONE
What will he be, my happiness?What a happy woman will she become, the little one
Antigone?What poverty It will be necessary what it too does, day by day, to
Tore with his teeth his little flap of happiness?Say, to whom should she lie,
Who to smile, who to sell?Who should she let die by looking away?
Creon, up the shoulders.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 56 -
You're crazy, shut up.
ANTIGONE
No, I won't be silent!I want to know how I would take, too, to
to be happy.Immediately, since it is right away that you have to choose.Vo us say that
It's so beautiful, life.I want to know how I will take to live.
 
Creon
Do you like Hémon?
ANTIGONE
Yes, Jaime Hémon.I like a hard and young hemon;a demanding and faithful hemon,
like me.But if your life, your happiness must go to him with their wear and tear, if
Hémon must no longer turn pale when I pale, if no longer should believe me dead when I am in
Five -minute delay, Sil should no longer feel alone in the world and hate me when I
Ris without knowing why, Sil must become close to me the Hémon, if it must
Append to say "yes", too, so I no longer have Hémon.
Creon
You no longer know what you say.Shut up.
ANTIGONE
Yes, I know what I say, but it is you who do not lie anymore.I'm talking to you too much
far now, a kingdom where you can no longer enter with your wrinkles, your
wisdom, your belly.(She laughs.) Ah!I laugh, Creon, I laugh because I see you at fifteen,
all of a sudden!It is the same DIMPUTION AIR AND CRO It can be anything.Life you
Only added these little folds to the face and this fat around you.
Creon, shakes it.
Will you be sure, finally?
ANTIGONE
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 57 -
Why do you want to silence me?Because you know I was right?You think I don't
Not reading in your eyes that you know it?You know that I have reason, but you will never lavou
Because you are defending your happiness right now like a bone.
Creon
Yours and mine, yes, fool!
ANTI Gone
You all disgust me, with your happiness!With your life that you have to love cost that
cost.It looks like dogs that lick everything they find.And this little chance for
Every day, if we are not too demanding.I want everything right away, and it's
whole or I refuse!I don't want to be modest, I, and be satisfied with a little one
piece if I was very wise.I want to be sure of everything today and that it is also
beautiful when I was little or die. Creon
Come on, start, like your father!
 
ANTIGONE
Like my father, yes!We are one of those who ask the questions up to the end.
Until what he really remains the smallest chance of living, the smallest
Chance Despir to strangle.We are one of those who jump on him when they
Meet your hope, your dear hope, your dirty hope!
Creon
Shut up!If you saw yourself shouting these words, you are ugly.
ANTIGONE
Yes, I'm ugly!It's ignoble, n Is it not, these cries, these bursts, this struggle of
ragpickers.Daddy has become beautiful quantity, when he was of course, finally, he had
killed his father, that it was well with his mother that he had slept, and that nothing, nothing
could save him.So he knew suddenly, he had a smile, and he is
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 58 -
become beautiful.It was finished.He had more than to close his eyes so as not to see you.Ah!
Your heads, your poor heads of candidates for Bonheu R!You are ugly, even
the most beautiful.You all have something ugly at the corner of Loeil or mouth.
You said well said earlier, Creon, cooking.You have cooking heads!
Creon, crushes her arm.
I'm twisted to be silent now, do you hear?
ANTIGONE
Are you biting, cook?Do you think you can bite something?
Creon
Lantichambre is full of people.So do you want to get lost?We're going to try.
ANTIGONE
Well, opens the doors.Precisely, he S will lie!
Creon, who tries to close his mouth.
Are you going to do yourself, finally, good Lord?
Antigone, struggles.
Come on, cook!Call your guards!
 
 
 
 
The door opens.Between Ismene.
Ismène, in a cry.
Antigone!
ANTIGONE
What do you want, too?
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 59 -
Ismene
Antigone, sorry!Antigone, you see, I come, I have courage.I will now I will with you.
ANTIGONE
Where will you go with me?
 
Ismene
If you make her die, he fai Dra kill me with her!
ANTIGONE
Ah!No.Not now.Not you!It's me, it's me alone.You don't appear that
You're going to come and die with me now.It would be too easy!
Ismene
I don't want to live if you die, I don't want to stay without you!
ANTIGONE
You chose life and I death.Leave me now with your jérémiades.It was necessary
Go there this morning, on all fours, at night.You had to go and scratch the earth with your nails
While they were close And get you through them like a thief!
Ismene
Well, I will see tomorrow!
ANTIGONE
Are you slow, Creon?Her too.Who knows if it is not going to take otherwise,
By reinforcement?What you wait to be silent, what you wait for
call your guards?Come on, Creon, a little courage, it is only a bad time to
pass.Come on, cook, since necessary!
Creon, suddenly shouts.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 60 -
Guards!
 
The guards appear immediately t.
Creon
Take it.
Antigone, in a large, relieved cry.
Finally, Creon!
 
The guards throw themselves on her and lemmene.Ismène comes out, shouting behind her.
 
Ismene
Antigone!Antigone!
 
 
 
 
Creon remained alone, the choir enters and goes to him.
THE CHOIR
You're crazy, Creon.What did you do?
Creon, who looks away in front of him.
What die.
THE CHOIR
Don't let Antigone die, Creon!We will all wear this wound alongside,
For centuries.
 
Creon
She is the one who wanted to die.None of us was strong enough to decide it to live.I the
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 61 -
Understanding, now Antigone was made to be dead.She herself knew it
Maybe not, but Polynice was not the pretext.When she had to give it up, she has
found something else right away.What mattered for her, it was to refuse and
die.
THE CHOIR
It is a child, Creon.
Creon
What do you want me to do for her?Condemn her to live?
Hémon, between E n shouting.
Father!
Creon, runs to him, lembrasse.
Forget it, Hémon;Forget it, my little one.
Hemon
You're crazy, father.Let go of me.
Creon, holds it stronger
I tried everything to save her, Hémon.I tried everything, I swear.She doesn't love your
not.She could have lived.She preferred her madness and death.
Hémon, shouts, trying to sack in his embrace.
But, father, you can see that they are lemmeting!Father, don't leave these men lemmener!
Creon
She talked about now.All thebes knows what has do.I have to do it
die.
Hémon, Sarch of his arms.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 62 -
Let go of me!
 
A silence.They are one in front of the other.They look at each other.
The choir, built.
Can we not imagine something, say what is crazy, lenfermer?
Creon
They will say that this is not true.That I save her because what was going to be the woman of
my son.I can't.
THE CHOIR
Can't we save time, scare her away tomorrow?
Creon
Crazy Already knows, she screams around the palace.I can't.
Hemon
Father, the crowd is nothing.You are the master.
Creon
I am the master before the law.More after.
Hemon
Father, I'm your son, you can't let him take it.
Creon
Yes, Hémon.Yes, my little one.Bravery.Antigone can no longer live.Antigone has us
Already left all.
Hemon
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 63 -
Do you think I can live without her?Do you think I will lack your life?And
Depuited every day S in the morning until evening, without her.And your agitation, your
Chatter, your void, without it.
Creon
You will have to accept, Hémon.Each of us has one day, more or less
Sad, more or less distant, where he must finally agree to be a man.For you, it's
today ... and here you are in front of me with these tears at the edge of your eyes and your heart which
hurts my little boy, for the last time ... when you have diverted yourself, when
You will have crossed this threshold every time, it will be finished.
Hémon, backs up a little, and says gently.
It's already over.
Creon
Don't judge me, Hémon.Don't judge me too.
Hémon, look at him, and suddenly says.
This great strength and this courage, this giant God who was lying in his arms and
saved monsters and shadows, did you?This well -defended smell and this good bread of
evening under the lamp, when you showed me books in your office, did you think?
Creon, humbly.
Yes, Hémon.
Hemon.
All these care, all this pride, all s these books full of heroes, so it was for
arrive there?Being a man, as you say, and too happy to live?
Creon,
Yes, Hémon.
Hémon, suddenly shouts like a child, throwing himself into his arms.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 64 -
Father, this is not true!It's not you, it's not today!We are not
Both at the foot of this wall where you only have to say yes.You are still powerful, you,
like when I was little.Ah!I do not beg, father, that I tadmore, that I tadmir e
Again!I am too lonely and the world is too naked if I can no longer tadmize.
Creon, detaches him from him.
We are alone, Hémon.The world is naked.And you are admired for too long.
Look at me is it becoming a man, seeing his father's face opposite one day.
Hémon, look at him, then backs off, shouting.
Antigone!Antigone!Help!
 
He was running out.
The choir goes to Creon.
Creon, he came out like crazy.
Creon, who looks far away, right in front of him, motionless.
Yes.Pau Vre small, he likes it.
THE CHOIR
Creon, you have to do something.
Creon
I can't do anything anymore.
THE CHOIR
He left, touched to death.
Creon, deafness.
Yes, we are all affected to death.
 
 
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 65 -
 
Antigone enters the room, pushed by the guards who sarfty against the door,
Behind which we guess the howling crowd.
 
THE GUARD
Chef, they invade the palace!
ANTIGONE
Creon, I don't want to see their faces anymore, I don't want to hear anymore their cries, I do not
Want to see anyone!You have my death now, it's enough.Make I don't see anymore
person until it is finished.
Creon, gets out, shouting at the guards.
The guard at the doors!What empty the palace!Stay here with her.
 
The other two guards come out, followed by the choir.Antigone remains alone with the
First guard.Antigone looks at him.
Antigone, suddenly says.
So, are you?
THE GUARD
Who me?
ANTIGONE
My last dhomme face.
THE GUARD
Must believe.
YEAR Tigon
That I look at you ...
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 66 -
The guard, seully, embarrassed.
How are you.
ANTIGONE
Are you the one who is stopped, earlier?
THE GUARD
Yes it's me.
ANTIGONE
You hurt me.You didn't have to hurt me.Was I Lair de
Want to save me?
THE GUARD
Come on.Come on, no dhistories!If it wasn't you, it was me who went there.
ANTIGONE
How old are you?
 
THE GUARD
Thirty nine years.
ANTIGONE
Do you have children?
THE GUARD
Yes, two.
ANTIGONE
T u loves?
THE GUARD
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 67 -
This is none of your business.
 
He starts to take a hundred steps in the room: for a while we no longer
that the noise of his steps.
Antigone, asks everything humble.
Have you been keeping for a long time?
 
THE GUARD
After the war.I was a sergeant.I rengated it.
ANTIGONE
Do you have to be a sergeant to be guarded?
THE GUARD
In principle, yes.Sergeant or have followed the special peloton.Become guard, the sergeant
Loses his rank.An exemplit E: I meet a root of tear, she can't
greet.
ANTIGONE
Oh yes?
THE GUARD
Yes.Notice that, generally, it does.The recruit knows that the guard is a
grade.Question balance: we have the ordinary balance of the guard, like those of the special peloton,
and, for six months, as a gratuity, a reminder of supplement of the balance of
sergeant.Only, as guards, we have other advantages.Accommodation, heating,
allowances.Finally, the guard married to two children arrive to do more than the
lactive sergeant.
ANTIGONE
Oh yes?
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 68 -
THE GUARD
Yes.This is what explains the rivalry between the guard and the sergeant.You may have
To be able to notice that the sergeant affects to despise the guard.Their great argument,
It is washing.It is right.Washing of the guard is slower and more
difficult only in tear.But you must not forget that a brigadier of the guards,
It is something else that a chef sergeant.
Antig One, suddenly said to him.
Listening…
THE GUARD
Yes.
ANTIGONE
I'm going to die earlier.
 
The guard does not answer.A silence.He takes the hundred steps.At the end of the moment, he resumes.
THE GUARD
Of the other side, there is more consideration for the guard than for the sergeant to
lactive.The guard is a soldier, but he is almost a civil servant.
ANTIGONE
Do you think it hurts to die?
 
 
THE GUARD
I can not tell you.During the war, those who were touched in the belly, they
hurt .I was not injured.And, a sense, it naked for washing.
ANTIGONE
How are they going to kill me?
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 69 -
THE GUARD
I don't know.I think I heard that so as not to defile the city of your
Blood, they were going to wall you in a hole.
ANTIGONE
Alive?
THE GUARD
Yes, dabord.
 
A silence.The guard is made a quid.
ANTIGONE
O Tomb!O Nuptial bed!O My underground home! ... (she is very small in the middle
of the great Pi naked.It looks like what a little cold.She feels with her arms.She
whispers.) All alone ...
The guard, who finished his chique.
At the Hades caves, at the gates of the city.In broad daylight.A funny chore
still for those who will be of faction.He had been a question of putting tearful.
But, in the latest news, it seems that it is still the guard who will provide the stakes.
She has a good back, the guard!Surprising yourself after there is jealousy between the guard and the
Sergeant DA ctive ...
Antigone, murmur, sudden tired.
Two animals ...
THE GUARD
What, two animals?
ANTIGONE
Beasts would tighten moon against the other to get hot.I'm alone.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 70 -
THE GUARD
If you need something, it's different.I can call.
ANTIGONE
No.I only would like you to put a letter back to someone when I will be
dead.
THE GUARD
How does a letter?
ANTIGONE
A letter that I will have.
THE GUARD
Ah!No!Not dhi Sticks!A letter!As you go, you!I would risk big,
Me, this little game!
ANTIGONE
I will give you this ring if you accept.
THE GUARD
It's gold?
ANTIGONE
Yes.It's gold.
THE GUARD
You understand, if I am excavated, I am the war council.It is equal to you,
to you?(He still looks at the ring.) What I can, if you want is to write on
My notebook what you would have wanted to say.Afterwards, Jarracherai the page.Of my writing,
It is not the same.
ANTIGONE , has her eyes closed: she whispers with a poor grin.
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 71 -
Your writing ... (she has a little thrill.) It's too ugly, all that is too ugly.
The vexed guard pretends to return the ring.
You know, if you don't want to, me ...
ANTIGONE
Si. Keep the ring and write.But do it quickly ... I am afraid that we will have the time more ...
Write: "My darling ..."
The guard, who took his notebook and sucks his mine.
Is it for your good friend?
ANTIGONE
My darling, I wanted Mouri r and you may not go maimer ...
The guard, slowly repeats of his big voice by writing.
"My darling, I wanted to die and you may no longer go maimer ..."
ANTIGONE
And Creon was right, it's terrible now, next to this man, I don't know anymore
Why am I die.I am scared…
The guard, who struggles on his dictation.
"Creon was right, it's terrible ..."
ANTIGONE
Oh!Hémon, our little boy.I only understand it now how much
It was easy to live ...
Le Garde, Sarrtie.
E H!Say, you go too fast.How do you want Jcrive?It takes time everything
likewise…

ANTIGONE
Where were you?
The guard rereads himself.
"It's terrible now next to this man ..."
 
ANTIGONE
I don't know why I die.
The guard, writes, sucking his mine.
"I don't know why I die ..." You never know why we die.
Antigone, continues.
I am afraid… (She is sadly. She suddenly stands.) No.Raye all of this.It would be better
that No one knows it.It was like it should see me naked and touch me
When I would be dead.Put only: "Sorry."
 
 
THE GUARD
So, do I scratch the end and sorry instead?
ANTIGONE
Yes.Sorry, my darling.Without the little antigone, you would have all been very quiet.
I love you…
THE GUARD
“Without the little antigone, you would have all been very quiet.I love you… ”It's
All?
ANTIGONE
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 73 -
Yes that's all.
THE GUARD
It is a funny letter.
ANTIGONE
Yes, it's a funny letter.
THE GUARD
And who is it to?
 
At that moment, the door is in the door.The other guards appear.Antigone gets up,
Look, look at the first guard who was erected behind her;He pockets the ring and
Store the notebook, important lair ... he sees the gaze dantigone.He mouths to give himself a
capacity.
THE GUARD
Come on!No stories!
 
 
 
Antigone has a poor smile.She lowers her head.She goes without a word to the others
guards.They all go out.
 
 
 
The choir, between suddenly.
There!It's over for Antigone.Maintained, the Creon Tour is approaching.They will have to
all go.
The messenger, bursting, shouting.
The Queen?Where is the queen?

THE CHOIR
What do you want?Do you have to teach him?
THE MESSENGER
Terrible news.We had just thrown Antigone in his hole.We didn't have
still finished rolling the last blocks of stone when Creon and all those Who
slowly hear complaints that suddenly come out of the tomb.Everyone is silent and
Listen, because it is not the dantigone voice.It is a new complaint that comes out of
depths of the hole ... all look at Creon, and he, who guessed the first, he who knows
Already before all the others, suddenly screams like a madman: "Remove the stones!"Remove
the stones!"The slaves throw themselves on the blocks piled up and, among them, the sweating king,
whose hands bleed.The stones finally move and the PL US MINCE SLOW IN
Louverture.Antigone is at the bottom of the grave hanging from the sons of his belt, sons
blue, green threads, red threads that make him like a Denfant necklace, and Hémon to
knees that holds her in her arms and groaned, her face buried in her dress.We move a
Block again and Creon can finally go down.We see her white hair in the light, at
bottom of the hole.He tries to note Hémon, he begs him.Hémon is not slow.Then
suddenly he stands, black eyes, And he never looked so much like the little boy
From the past, he looks at his father without saying anything, a minute, and suddenly he spits at him
Face, and pulls his sword.Creon jumped out of reach.So Hémon looks at him with his
Denfant eyes, heavy with contempt, and Creon cannot avoid this look like the blade.
Hémon looks at this old man trembling at the end of the cave, and, without saying anything,
He immerses herself made in the belly and he stucks against Antigone, lembraging in a
immense Red puddle.
Creon, enters his page.
I made them sleep by Lautre, finally!They are washed now, rested.They
are only a little pale, but so calm.Two lovers in the aftermath of the
First night.They finished them.
 
THE CHOIR

Not you, Creon.You still have something to learn.Eurydice, the Queen, your
women…
Creon
A good woman speaking always of her garden, her jams, her knitwear,
his eternal t RICOTS for the poor.It's funny as the poor have eternally
need knitting.It looks like they have to need knitting ...
THE CHOIR
The poor of Thebes will be cold this winter Creon.By learning the death of his
son, the queen put her needles, wisely, after having finished her rank, calmly,
Like all that fact, a little more quietly perhaps than Dhabititude.And then
She went to her room, her lavender lodent room, to the little ones
Crownstart And to the tual frames, to cut the throat, Creon.She is
now extended to one of the small old -fashioned twin beds, in the same place where you tire
View young girl one evening, and with the same smile, barely a little sadder.And Sil Ny had
not this large red spot on the cloths around his neck, one might think what
sleeps.
Creon
Her too.They all sleep.It's good.The day was tough.(A time. He says
Deaf) it must be good to sleep.
THE CHOIR
And you are all T alone now, Creon
Creon
All alone, yes.(A silence. He puts his hand on the lepaule of his page.) Small…
THE PAGE
Sir?
Creon
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 76 -
I'll tell you.They don't know, others;We are there, in front of the wolf, we do not
Can not cross your arms.They say it's a dirty work, but if we
Don't do it, who will do it?
THE PAGE
I do not know sir
Creon
Of course, you don't know.You are lucky!What it would be necessary is n e never
know.Are you looking forward to being big?
THE PAGE
Oh yes, sir!
Creon
You're crazy, small.You should never become big.(The hour rings in the distance, he whispers)
Five hours.What we have today, at five o'clock?
THE PAGE
Advice, sir.
Creon
Well, if we have advice, small, we will go.
 
They go out, Creon that sapputs on the page.
 
 
The choir, Savance.
And There you go.Without the little antigone, it's true, they would have all been very quiet.But
my Inteury is over.They are still quiet.Everyone who had to die
are dead.Those who believed one thing, and then those who believed the very opposite
Those who believed nothing and who were caught in the story without anything
Jean Anouilh - Antigone -
- 77 -
to understand.Loving such, all, very steep, very useless, well rotten.And those who
Also live will begin to forget them very slowly and confuse their names.
It's finish.Antigone is calm , now we will never know what fever.Her
duty is given to him.A great sad appeasement falls on Thebes and on the empty palace
where Creon will start to wait for death.
 
While he spoke, the guards entered.They settled on a bench, their liter of
Red next to two, their hat on the neck, and they started a game of cards.
THE CHOIR
There are only the guards left.They are all equal to them;It's not their onions.
They continue to Jo Uer in cards ...
 
The curtain falls quickly while the guards fell their assets.
End of "Antigone"
